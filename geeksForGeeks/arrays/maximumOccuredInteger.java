 * Maximum occured integer Easy Accuracy: 44.71% Submissions: 11865 Points: 2 Given N integer
 * ranges, the task is to find the maximum occurring integer in these ranges. If more than one such
 * integer exits, find the smallest one. The ranges are given as two arrays L[] and R[]. L[i]
 * consists of starting point of range and R[i] consists of corresponding end point of the range.
 *
 * <p>For example consider the following ranges. L[] = {2, 1, 3}, R[] = {5, 3, 9) Ranges represented
 * by above arrays are. [2, 5] = {2, 3, 4, 5} [1, 3] = {1, 2, 3} [3, 9] = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} The
 * maximum occurred integer in these ranges is 3.
 *
 * <p>Example 1:
 *
 * <p>Input: N = 4 L[] = {1,4,3,1} R[] = {15,8,5,4} Output: 4 Explanation: The given ranges are
 * [1,15] [4, 8] [3, 5] [1, 4]. The number that is most common or appears most times in the ranges
 * is 4.
 *
 * <p>Example 2:
 *
 * <p>Input: N = 5 L[] = {1,5,9,13,21} R[] = {15,8,12,20,30} Output: 5 Explanation: The given ranges
 * are [1,15] [5, 8] [9, 12] [13, 20] [21, 30]. The number that is most common or appears most times
 * in the ranges is 5.
 *
 * <p>Your Task: The task is to complete the function maxOccured() which returns the maximum occured
 * integer in all ranges.
 *
 * <p>Expected Time Complexity: O(N). Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
 *
 * <p>Constraints: 1 <= n <= 10^6 0 <= L[i], R[i] <= 10^6
