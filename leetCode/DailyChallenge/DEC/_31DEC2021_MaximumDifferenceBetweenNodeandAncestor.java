 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.
 *
 * A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
 * |8 - 3| = 5
 * |3 - 7| = 4
 * |8 - 1| = 7
 * |10 - 13| = 3
 * Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [1,null,2,null,0,3]
 * Output: 3
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 5000].
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 105
