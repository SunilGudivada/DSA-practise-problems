/**
 * @docs https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/
 * In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
 *
 * If the town judge exists, then:
 *
 * The town judge trusts nobody.
 * Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
 * There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
 * You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.
 *
 * Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
 * Output: 2
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
 * Output: 3
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
 * Output: -1
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 1000
 * 0 <= trust.length <= 10^4
 * trust[i].length == 2
 * All the pairs of trust are unique.
 * ai != bi
 * 1 <= ai, bi <= n
