 * @docs https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-distance-to-closest-person/
 * You are given an array representing a row of seats where seats[i] = 1 represents a person sitting in the ith seat, and seats[i] = 0 represents that the ith seat is empty (0-indexed).
 * <p>
 * There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.
 * <p>
 * Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized.
 * <p>
 * Return that maximum distance to the closest person.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: seats = [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * If Alex sits in the second open seat (i.e. seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
 * If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
 * Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: seats = [1,0,0,0]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * If Alex sits in the last seat (i.e. seats[3]), the closest person is 3 seats away.
 * This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: seats = [0,1]
 * Output: 1
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 2 <= seats.length <= 2 * 104
 * seats[i] is 0 or 1.
 * At least one seat is empty.
 * At least one seat is occupied.
